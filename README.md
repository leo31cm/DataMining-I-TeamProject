# DataMining-I-TeamProject

# Tasks
Content Table for Report:
1. Application area and goals (Yen-Chun)
2. Structure and size of the data set (minimum 1 page, see kaggle Kernel), Graphs (Yen-Chun)
3. Preprocessing and Mining  
	• describe different approaches and parameter settings that you tried (Everyone for his classifier/algo)  
	• including evaluation setup and evaluation results (Everyone for his classifier/algo)  
	• including discussion of the results (Everyone for his classifier/algo)  
4. Summary of Results (Ting-Yi)  
5. Conclusion (Ting-Yi)  

Formatting of paper in latex template and also make sure all requirements are met (Ting-Yi).  


ALgorithms:
- KNN (Tobias)
- Support Vector Machines (Karan)
- Random Forests (Charlene)
- DecisionTree (Tobias)
- Naive Bayes (Marcel)



The finished scrpits for KNN must be used as a template for every algorithm  
--> Meaning loading the data and saving it have to be as they are in the follwing files:
	
	KNeighborsClassifier_paramTuning.ipynb
 
	KNeighborsClassifier.ipynb
  
Why does that make sense?   
--> Less work for Person Y and more transparency on the results. Plus a better comparability
