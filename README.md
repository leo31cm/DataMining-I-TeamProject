# DataMining-I-TeamProject

Used algorithms
- KNN (Tobias)
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forests
- DecisionTree
- Naive Bayes (Marcel)


# Tasks
Content Table for Report:
1. Application area and goals (Person X)
2. Structure and size of the data set (minimum 1 page, see kaggle Kernel), Graphs (Person X)
3. Preprocessing and Mining 
	• describe different approaches and parameter settings that you tried (Everyone for his classifier/algo)
	• including evaluation setup and evaluation results (Everyone for his classifier/algo)
	• including discussion of the results (Everyone for his classifier/algo)
4. Summary of Results (Person Y)
5. Conclusion (Person Y)

Formatting of paper in latex template and also make sure all requirements are met (Person Y).  


ALgorithms:
- KNN (Tobias)
- Support Vector Machines (Person W)
- Random Forests (Person Z)
- DecisionTree (Tobias)
- Naive Bayes (Marcel)



The finished scrpits for KNN must be used as a template for every algorithm
--> Meaning loading the data and saving it have to be as they are in the follwing files:
	KNeighborsClassifier_paramTuning.ipynb
 
	KNeighborsClassifier.ipynb

Why does that make sense? 
--> Less work for Person Y and more transparency on the results. Plus a better comparability
